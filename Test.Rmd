# Learning to Reference Figures

```{r FigureActivity2}
x = seq(1:100) 
y = rnorm(100) 
dat = data.frame(x, y) 
ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(caption = "This is Random Noise")
```

Above is a figure \@ref(FigureActivity2) that shows random noise. 

# Learning to Reference Tables 

```{r table1}
kable(head(dat, 5)) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

Above is a table \@ref(FigureActivity2) showing the first 5 data points.
